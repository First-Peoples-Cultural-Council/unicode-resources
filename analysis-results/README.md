# FirstVoices Unicode Confusables and Adjacency Pair Databases

These files represent the results of analysis on the language data hosted on the FirstVoices platform. The analysis was completed in March 2022.

## Unicode 'Confusables' Database 

This is a collection of Unicode characters found primarily within BC-based Indigenous languages, alongside the Unicode characters that can be mistakenly used in place of them. There is one file:

1. all_characters_confusables

## Unicode 'Adjacency Pair' Database 

This is an aggregated collection of Unicode-based character pairs used in BC-based Indigenous languages, alongside a snapshot of their type-based frequencies from the FirstVoices language platform. It demonstrates the relative frequency of different Unicode characters as well as the relative frequency of adjacent pairs of characters, across BC-based Indigenous languages. There are three component resources: 

1. adjacency_pairs_by_codepoint : a database of pairs by Unicode codepoint
2. adjacency_pairs_by_grapheme : a database of pairs by grapheme
3. graphemes : a list of graphemes
