# FirstVoices Unicode Confusables and Adjacency Pair Databases

## What are these databases?

The FirstVoices Unicode 'Confusables' Database is a collection of Unicode characters found primarily within BC-based Indigenous languages, alongside the Unicode characters that can be mistakenly used in place of them.

The FirstVoices Unicode 'Adjacency Pair' Database is an aggregated collection of Unicode-based character pairs used in BC-based Indigenous languages, alongside a snapshot of their type-based frequencies from the FirstVoices language platform. It demonstrates the relative frequency of different Unicode characters as well as the relative frequency of adjacent pairs of characters, across BC-based Indigenous languages. There are three component resources: a database of pairs by Unicode codepoint, a database of pairs by grapheme, and a list of graphemes.

## Why are we publishing these databases?

Indigenous languages are sorely underrepresented online and in digital spaces. UTF-8 is the standard encoding that should be used, as it provides access to all the unicode symbols necessary. Despite that, thorough testing is necessary to make digital environments truly inclusive. We see this work as useful and applicable for digital projects, whether they have an Indigenous focus or not.

Some examples of where these resources may be of use:

- Testing fonts – Is your font equipped to handle Indigenous languages in the correct way?
- Building and testing keyboards – Does your keyboard employ the Unicode characters that are correct for the language you're working with?
- Checking for Unicode discrepancies within Indigenous-language data sets – Are there 'confusables' within a document or data set that may cause issues later on?
- Improving search functionality within Indigenous-language software – Are there instances of 'confusables' in your language data that may be reducing functionality?
- Other – If you have an application for this work that we haven't considered, please let us know!
